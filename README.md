- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jack
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the C programming language
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement parallel processing, and how to make my code as portable as possible 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jack.e.tobin@outlook.com

I love anything that has to do with C, but I'm still very much a newbie as far as writing code goes. I'm also learning how to use git, because I'd like to be a bit more active, a bit more consistently, than I am right now.
If you've got any questions about anything I've written, do feel free to reach out any time!
